Week 1
This week we chose Peter as the scrum master and created the repo, Jira as well as formed groups on
Moodle. We confirmed that we wanted to create a Queue Management System used primarily for the 
purpose of help sessions and then did brainstorming of what possible tech stack we used. We ended the
week debating the idea of using Rust for the backend. Since majority of the group has no previous
experience with Rust, we decided to do a quick crash course on the basics of Rust to see if it was
wise for us to use.
