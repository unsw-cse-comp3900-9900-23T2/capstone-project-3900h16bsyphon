Week 1
This week we chose Peter as the scrum master and created the repo, Jira as well as formed groups on
Moodle. We confirmed that we wanted to create a Queue Management System used primarily for the 
purpose of help sessions and then did brainstorming of what possible tech stack we used. We ended the
week debating the idea of using Rust for the backend. Since majority of the group has no previous
experience with Rust, we decided to do a quick crash course on the basics of Rust to see if it was
wise for us to use. 

Week 2
This week, our main aim was to get our custom project approved by our tutor and the lecturer. Due to 
this we had to make many last minute updates in order to ensure that the project was in fact broad
enough for a proper product to be produced. Once approved, our team had a meeting where we finalised 
our objectives, novel features and assigned user stories. The week concluded with us meeting to finalised
all user stories and ensuring that the Jira tickets are accurate and up to date with epics, objectives
and user stories. I focussed on working on Peter with the proposal as well as completing epics for
User History novel feature.
